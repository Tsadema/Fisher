# FisherBot

Super specific customizable bot used for grinding the discord bot VirtualFisher.

I know "super specific" and "customizable" don't go together.


# Installation

*You need to install python first before you can use this program. Install it at https://www.python.org/downloads.*

*Installation is assuming you're using Windows. If you're using Linux, you probably know what to do already.*

Click the big green button that says Code > Download ZIP.

Right click the zip file in Explorer > Extract All > Extract.
Click through the folders until you find the three files.
Run the program by double-clicking main.py in the window that pops up.
