# FisherBot

Super specific customizable bot used for grinding the discord bot VirtualFisher.

I know "super specific" and "customizable" don't go together.


# Installation

*You need to install python first before you can use this program. Install it at https://www.python.org/downloads.*

Click the big green button that says Code > Download ZIP. If you have WinRAR or a similar program, you may not need to decompress the zip file.

If you don't have something like WinRAR, you can just right click the zip file > Extract All.
Then click main.py and you're done!
